# Kanban board Static HTML CSS Website

In this project I coded a simple Kanban Board where you have To Do's, that you can move around
With the help of the `HTML API`. Docs are here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API.

This project thaught me the use of the `HTML API` followed by more practice with CSS and Javascript.
